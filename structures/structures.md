# Structures

## Syntax for declaration

```c
struct MyStructure {   // Structure declaration
  int myNum;           // Member (int variable)
  char myLetter;       // Member (char variable)
}; // End the structure with a semicolon
```
Example:
```c
struct Student {   // Structure declaration
  char name[50], rollno;       // Member (char variable)
  int myNum;           // Member (int variable)
}; // End the structure with a semicolon
```
